# Lots and lots of languages

There are so many god damn languages and they are all different

- Pure languages in the sense that they are just the lang like Python, Go, C++, etc.

- Languages in the sense that they are a framework like Ruby on Rails, Node.js

# Execution

- Compiled
- Interpreted

## Compiled 

Compiled langaues are directly translated to machine code
Different compilations for different os's like linux x64 vs. Windows x32


## Interpreted

Not directly compiled to machine code. Instead translated indirectly to machine code.
Individual lines of source when executed to machine code.
Does not need to be rewritten for other os's.
Tend to be slower

# Intermediate Languages

Languages are translated to a common langauge that is provided by a runtime.
This common code is similar to machine code but not quite.

This runtime is able to take this "special machine code" and is able to turn it to machine code.

Examples of this are the JVM and the .Net Framework

These are commonly used becasue they have alot of quality of life development perks like Garbage collection and 
Security enhancements. These also run in a sort of VM like state inside of the computer that allows for better security.

# Other Notes regarding Python

Python is a multi paradigm languages and break the conditional mold with regards to its complitation.

Python does not produce and executable like Java or C#
